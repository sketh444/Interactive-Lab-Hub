# The Tail of Two Kitties

## Project Description

This project consists of two interactive kitties that respond in cat like ways when touched by the user. When pet the cats purr, wag thier tags, move thier paws, and meow. These two cats are also connected. When both cats are being interacted with at the same time a heart light will turn on, on both the cats and the cats will meow. The goals of this project are to create an emotional experience for users similar to petting a cat and to connect long distance friends through interacting with our cats. 

The inspiration for this project stems a lot from our time quarantined during 2020 and wishing we had both a pet to interact with and connection with our friends. We were also very much inspirated by the research of Ran Zhou that highlights the emotional response in users from robotic physical contact (https://www.ranzhourobot.com/).

## Design Process

To create these two cats we used the following technology: 
- Raspberry Pi
- Capacitive touch sensors
- Servo motors
- MQTT communication
- Speakers
- LED Light

The appearance of the cats was made up of: 
- Cardboard 
- A furry sweater 
- Conductive tape 
- Wire 
- Yarn 
- Ribbon

To start building these two cats, we first created a simple 2D card borad verison of the cats to ensure all the technology would work well together and to prototype user ineraction. The 2D verison of the cats used the servo motor to move a cardbord arm of the cat when it is touched. The 2D cats also purr when they are touched and demonstrate the connection between the two cats when both 2D cats are touched at the same time by shine a red LED light through a paper heart.

After validating that all of our technological components worked well together and testing our 2D cats with some peer users we began constructing the 3D cats. Our plan to create these 3D cats was to created a cardborad skeleton for the cats, place wires for sensors and servo motors in the skelton and cover the cardboard skelton with fur to give a cat like appearance and feel. 

To create the cats cardbord skelton, we found some 3D model puzzles online and used to a laser cutter to cut them pieces. This process took us much time and experimentation. The first cat 3D model puzzles we found looked nice but when cut there was way too many pieces and we struggled to put it together. This lead us to finding a new model with less pieces that was more managable for our project. Once we selected our model we had to experiment with cardboard thickness to find the best possible skeltons for our kitties.

Simpler cat 3D model puzzle we used:

Once had our cardboard skeletons created, we added in the servo motors and tested out the movement of our kitties as skelton cats. To do this, we detached the arm of the cat, cut a gap in the skelton to place the motor, and hot glued the detached cat arm to the wing of the motor. For the tail, we started by completely removing the cardboard tail and replacing it with wire cover in yarn (a more realistic looking tail). then the cut another gap in the rear of the cats to place thier tail motors.

Next we add metal places to the skelton for touch sensors [discuss how and why this failed] attached to alligator clips and covered the skeltons in furr. For the cat furr we used an old sweater we thirfted from Good Will. To get a cat shape from the furr we first created a pattern with thinner fabric and then cut it out of the thick furr material. Lastly we hot glued the furr coat on to the cat skeltons. 

Fabric pattern for furr:

The last step to the cats appearance was to add the heart light for interaction between the two cats. To do this we taped the LED lights to the chest of the cats, covered them in a thin furr to intensify thier shine, and put a duct tape heart on top of the chest furr. 

Heart light:

Under the cats we added a box for cat to stand on. This served to stablize the cat allowing it to stand and hide the pi, senors, and speaker from the user.
