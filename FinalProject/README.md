# The Tail of Two Kitties

## Project Description

This project consists of two interactive kitties that respond in cat like ways when touched by the user. When pet the cats purr, wag thier tags, move thier paws, and meow. These two cats are also connected. When both cats are being interacted with at the same time a heart light will turn on, on both the cats and the cats will meow. The goals of this project are to create an emotional experience for users similar to petting a cat and to connect long distance friends through interacting with our cats. 

The inspiration for this project stems a lot from our time quarantined during 2020 and wishing we had both a pet to interact with and connection with our friends. We were also very much inspirated by the research of Ran Zhou that highlights the emotional response in users from robotic physical contact (https://www.ranzhourobot.com/).

## Design Process

To create these two cats we used the following technology: 
- Raspberry Pi
- Capacitive touch sensors
- Servo motors
- MQTT communication
- Speakers
- LED Light

The appearance of the cats was made up of: 
- Cardboard 
- A furry sweater 
- Conductive tape 

To start building these two cats, we first created a simple 2D card borad verison of the cats to ensure all the technology would work well together and to prototype user ineraction. The 2D verison of the cats used the servo motor to move a cardbord arm of the cat when it is touched. The 2D cats also purr when they are touched and demonstrate the connection between the two cats when both 2D cats are touched at the same time by shine a red LED light through a paper heart.
